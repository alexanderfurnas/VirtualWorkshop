# Junior Americanist Workshop Series
A new virtual workshop for American politics reseach in the pandemic age.

## Mission
With the cancellation of conferences and seminar series due to COVID-19, we are starting a virtual workshop series, Junior Americanist Workshop Series, to provide an alternative opportunity for junior scholars (ABD grad students, post docs, and any early career faculty) who study American politics (behavior or institutions) to present and get feedback on their work and to network with other scholars with similar interests.

## Format
The workshop provides the opportunity for junior Americanist scholars to present their work and receive feedback. This term we are experimenting with a variety of formats, but each week will include at minimum two presentations, with individual discussions and questions to follow.

In addition to article-length manuscripts, we also encourage the submission of well-developed pre-analysis plans and research designs.  Submissions may be solo-authored or collaborative; if the submission is collaborative, we will give preference to those with junior scholars as coauthors.

We will try to match up discussants with papers based on subject area expertise to the best of our ability.

To make sure that participants can review all of the papers in the workshop in advance, we will collect and circulate the papers one week in advance.


## When
JAWS will be held the second and fourth of every month, 2-4pm Eastern time.

We will also be organizing networking opportunities in conjunction with our panels. For JAWS 1, we will offer a trivia game on Wednesday, September 30 starting at 8:00PM ET. Feel free to come with a team of your own or come alone and join forces with other JAWS participants!
