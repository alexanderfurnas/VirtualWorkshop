# Junior Americanist Workshop Series
A new virtual workshop for American politics reseach in the pandemic age.

## Mission
The Junior Americanist Workshop Series aims to provide an alternative opportunity for junior scholars (ABD grad students, post docs, and pre-tenure faculty) who study American politics (behavior or institutions) to present and get feedback on their work and to network with other scholars with similar interests.

## Format
The workshop provides the opportunity for junior Americanist scholars to present their work and receive feedback. This term we are experimenting with a variety of formats, but each week will include at minimum two presentations, with individual discussions and questions to follow.

In addition to article-length manuscripts, we also encourage the submission of well-developed pre-analysis plans and research designs.  Submissions may be solo-authored or collaborative; if the submission is collaborative, we will give preference to those with junior scholars as coauthors.

We will try to match up discussants with papers based on subject area expertise to the best of our ability.


*Please note:* We strongly encourage participants to read the presenters' papers in advance of the session.  We will circulate these papers via email at least one week in advance of the session.  We will allocate at least 10-15 minutes to audience Q & A after each presentation to provide an opportunity for you to share feedback.
