# Junior Americanist Workshop Series
A virtual workshop for American politics research.

## Mission
The Junior Americanist Workshop Series aims to provide an alternative opportunity for junior scholars (ABD grad students, post docs, and pre-tenure faculty) who study American politics (behavior or institutions) to present and get feedback on their work and to network with other scholars with similar interests.  While we focus on showcasing work from junior scholars, we welcome everyone (all ages/ranks/experience levels) to attend our events!

## Format
The workshop provides the opportunity for junior Americanist scholars to present their work and receive feedback.  Our current research workshop format is 90 minutes per session featuring 2 papers, each of which is allotted 45 minutes.  In each 45 minute block, authors present their paper for 20-25 minutes, discussants offer comments for 5-10 minutes, and the balance of the time is reserved for audience questions. 

In addition to article-length manuscripts, we also encourage the submission of well-developed pre-analysis plans and research designs.  Submissions may be solo-authored or collaborative; if the submission is collaborative, we will give preference to those with junior scholars as coauthors.

We will try to match up discussants with papers based on subject area expertise to the best of our ability.  If you have a dream discussant you'd like for your paper, please tell us and we will do our best to make it happen!

*Please note:* We strongly encourage participants to read the presenters' papers in advance of the session.  We will circulate these papers via email at least one week in advance of the session.  We will allocate at least 10-15 minutes to audience Q & A after each presentation to provide an opportunity for you to share feedback.
