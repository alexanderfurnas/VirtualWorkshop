## MPSA 2023 Mini-Conference: Call for Papers and Discussants

Submit your papers to the first ever JAWS in-person mini-conference to be held at MPSA 2023! Thanks to funding from the APSA Centennial Center, we’re able to offer *$350 to all accepted presenters* as well as a modest honorarium ($100) for discussants. We’ll also cover all meals.

This will be a day-long conference within a conference at MPSA, with the goal of bringing together junior American politics scholars to share their research, network, and discuss topics in professional development.

We are accepting all papers or well-developed pre-analysis plans from graduate students or individuals in non-tenure track positions. We have a strong preference for papers that are solo authored or co-authored with other non-TT individuals. Research across all subfields of American politics will be considered.

Conference format:

- Scheduled for first Thursday of MPSA (April 13)
- 10 papers accepted
- 20 minute presentations followed by 5 minute discussant comments and 10 minute Q&A
- Breakfast and lunch provided for all attendees
- Networking dinner for presenters and discussants (location TBD)
- Lunch time professional development roundtable
